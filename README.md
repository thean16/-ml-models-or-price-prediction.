# -ml-models-or-price-prediction.
For this project, the goal is to create a predictive model to analyze Panasonicâ€™s prod-
uct prices, in reference to Mathematics in Data Science and Machine Learning. The
project seeks to use historical pricing data, as well as factors that can have an effect on
price trends, to guide consumers and businesses. The research will attempt to recog-
nize trends and patterns that influence pricing by examining a pool of data, primarily
composed of properties such as equipment type, category, price range, year produced,
and average price. It enables the consumer to be more informed about when to buy the
product and the business to know what prices, sales, plan promotions, and inventory are
optimal.
